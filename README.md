Azure ARM (Azure Resource Manager) is a management framework in Microsoft Azure used for deploying and managing Azure resources. It provides a unified way to create, deploy, and manage Azure resources through templates and APIs.

ARM templates are JSON files that describe the resources that need to be deployed to Azure. These templates can be used to deploy resources across multiple subscriptions and regions in a consistent and repeatable way. ARM templates can also be version controlled, making it easier to manage changes to the infrastructure over time.

ARM provides a declarative way of defining resources and their dependencies. This allows for the creation of complex environments with multiple resources and their interdependencies managed in a single template. ARM also allows for the creation of resource groups, which are logical containers for resources that can be managed together.

ARM templates can be deployed using the Azure Portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, and other tools. Once a template is deployed, it can be managed and updated using Azure Resource Manager.

Overall, Azure ARM provides a powerful and flexible way to manage Azure resources, and is a key component in building and managing cloud infrastructure in Microsoft Azure.
