Azure Resource Group is a fundamental concept in Microsoft Azure that serves as a logical container for a set of related resources. It is a unit of management that allows for the grouping, deployment, and monitoring of resources together.

Resource Groups enable the management of resources as a single entity, which makes it easier to deploy, monitor, and manage Azure resources. By grouping resources together in a Resource Group, it's possible to deploy, manage and delete resources as a group, rather than managing them individually.

Resource Groups can contain resources from different Azure services, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks. It is also possible to move resources from one Resource Group to another or across Azure subscriptions. This allows for greater flexibility in managing resources in Azure.

Additionally, Resource Groups can be assigned tags to help with the management and organization of resources. Tags can be used to categorize resources based on attributes such as the application they belong to, the environment they're deployed in, or the department that owns them.

Overall, Azure Resource Groups provide a powerful way to manage resources in Microsoft Azure, allowing for greater control and flexibility in managing complex deployments.
